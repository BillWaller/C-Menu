The config.json file in this directory is the one I used to render the very garish
colors in the screenshots included in C-Menu's README.md.

You can copy it to your ~/.config/tree-sitter/config.json to use it yourself, or
better yet, modify it to your liking!

You can find documentation on the format of this file in the tree-sitter wiki.
