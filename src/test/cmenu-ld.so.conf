# /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cmenu-ld.so.conf
# This file is used to specify additional library paths for the dynamic linker 
# to find shared libraries. It is typically placed in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ 
# directory.(ld.so).
# If you want to install libcm.so globally in /usr/local/lib64
# Add custom library path for cmenu
# Your system may require different paths
/usr/local/lib64

# After adding this file, you need to run `ldconfig` to update the linker cache:
# sudo ldconfig
#
# libcm.so is not versioned yet. This is not ideal because you will have to 
# manually make sure your executables can find a libcm.so that is compatible 
# with them. In the future, we will version libcm.so (e.g., libcm.so.1) and
# create a symlink (e.g., libcm.so -> libcm.so.1) to allow for better version 
# management.
