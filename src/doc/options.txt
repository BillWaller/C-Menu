        Initialization - Order of Execution and Priority

        Order  Priority  Source     Description
        -----  --------  ---------- -------------------------------------
          1       1      default    Default values
          2       2      config     Configuration file
          3       3      env        Environment variables
          4       5      options    Command line option arguments
          5       4      positional Command line positional arguments

        Notice that the execution order is not the same as the priority order.

        Higher priority values override lower priority values.

        executable positional arguments
        ---------- ------------------------------------------------
           menu    mapp-spec                            [help_spec]
           pick    in_spec    {out_spec    | cmd_spec}  [help_spec]
           form    mapp-spec  {answer_spec | cmd_spec}  [help_spec]
           view    argv[0], argv[1]...                  [help_spec]

        * Options and groups of options in square brackets are optional.
        * Options and groups of options in curly brackets are required.
        * Groups of options seperated by a vertical bars, '|' indicate
          that only one may be provided.
        * Groups of options seperated by a commas, ',' indicate none or
          more more may be provided.

        With no option arguments, pick's positional arguments are:
            0           1           2            3          4
           pick      in_spec    [out_spec]  |[cmd_spec] [help_spec]

        But if in_spec is provided by an option argument, then the positional
        arguments are:

            0           1           2            3
           pick     {out_spec  | cmd_spec} [help_spec]

        That's because in_spec has already been set by the option argument.

        If in_spec and out_spec are provided by option arguments, then the
        positional arguments are:

            0           1
           pick    [help_spec]

        In this case, only the first of the positional arguments in curly
        brackets is allowed. cmd_spec is disqualified when out_spec is
        provided.

        As you can see, pick only requires one argument, in_spec, which
        may be provided as a positional argument or as an option argument.
        If the other arguments are not provided, they will be fabricated
        as needed based on in_spec.  For example, if in_spec is provided
        as abcd.in, then out_spec will become abcd.out, and help_spec
        as abcd.help. Because only one of out_spec or cmd_spec is allowed,
        if out_spec is provided, cmd_spec will not be fabricated.

        Options can be provided on the command line as arguments to: 
            menu, pick, form, and view
        or, as directives in the mapp description files for menu, pick,
        and form.

        The options provided in the mapp description files are processed
        in the same manner as command line option arguments, and have the
        same priority (5).
