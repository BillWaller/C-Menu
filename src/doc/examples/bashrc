# BASH SHELL
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

# using xsh, or some other alias reduces visibility and
# vulnerability to some automated attacks and jerkware.
# You could just copy /bin/bash to /bin/xsh. Someone
# suggested a symbolic link, but that would defeat the purpose.
# Ideally, you would compile your own bash from source
# and name it xsh or something else obscure. A static build
# would be even better, but it involves more than just
# compiling bash with --static option. The most reasonable
# solution is to build a set of core libraries including
# libncursesw, tinfo, and readline as static libraries, then
# link bash against those static libraries. The resulting
# binary would be mostly static, except for a few libraries.
# This is left as an exercise for the reader.
#
# Once you have your xsh binary, place it somewhere in your PATH,
# then this line will set your SHELL variable to xsh.
# Leave "export SHELL=BASH" as a fallback. If xsh isn't available,
# you will still have a working shell. Nothing works without a shell.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# RSH
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# rsh is a small C program that provides a root shell to
# non-privileged users. It is intended for personal systems
# where you are the only user, or where you trust all users.
# It is NOT intended for multi-user systems where security
# is a concern.
# rsh works by being installed as a setuid root binary.
# When a non-privileged user runs rsh, it spawns a root shell.
# To exit the root shell, simply type "exit", press Ctrl-D, or,
# if you have a function like "x" below, just type "x".

# To install rsh, you need to compile it from source.
# You can get the source code from the cmenu project.
# Here are the steps to compile and install rsh:
#
# cd /usr/local/src/cmenu/src
# make
# sudo make install
# ls -l ~/menuapp/bin/rsh
# -rws--x--x. 1 root root 86240 Oct 25 18:48 /home/me/menuapp/bin/rsh
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# -- or --
# ----------------------------
# su
# cp rsh /usr/local/bin
# chown root:root /usr/local/bin/rsh
# chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/rsh
# ls /usr/local/bin/rsh
# -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 86240 Oct 25 20:00 /usr/local/bin/rsh
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Once rsh and the following functions are installed, you can,
# from a standard user shell, type "xx" to start a root shell,
# and "x" to exit that root shell.

which rsh >/dev/null 2>&1 && xx() { rsh; }

# Using the following function allows you to exit the root shell
# instantiated by the above function by typing "x".
#
# As an added benefit, it directs the output of exit to /dev/null,
# which suppresses the annoying "exit" message that adds another
# non-relevant line to your terminal.
# This is especially useful when you have nested shells and want
# to exit multiple levels without cluttering the terminal with
# exit messages.

x() { exit >/dev/null 2>&1; }

# old habits die hard - use vi command to start nvim

which nvim >/dev/null 2>&1 && vi() { nvim "$@"; }

# typing mm takes less time than menu if you use it often

which menu >/dev/null 2>&1 && mm() { menu "$@"; }

# colorize ls output if possible

which ls >/dev/null 2>&1 && ls() { /bin/ls --color=auto "$@"; }

# gdb alias to always start in silent mode

which gdb >/dev/null 2>&1 && gdb() { /usr/bin/gdb --silent "$@"; }

# when you go superuser. It's very low-key, as it should be, but relevant.
# Change the colors and information to suit your taste.

# responsiveness and usability. You can set this variable in your
