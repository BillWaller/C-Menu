	  All of the asynchronous communications ports use the same
	  general interface, no	matter what hardware is	involved.  The
	  remainder of this section discusses the common features of
	  this interface.

	  When a terminal file is opened, it normally causes the
	  process to wait until	a connection is	established.  In
	  practice, user programs seldom open terminal files; they are
	  opened by _g_e_t_t_y and become standard input, output, and error
	  files	for a user.

	  The very first terminal file opened by the process group
	  leader of a terminal file, which is not already associated
	  with a process group,	becomes	the _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l for that
	  process group.  The control terminal plays a special role in
	  handling quit	and interrupt signals, as discussed below.
	  The control terminal is inherited by a child process during
	  a _f_o_r_k(2).  A	process	can break this association by changing
	  its process group using _s_e_t_p_g_r_p(2).

	  A terminal associated	with a terminal	file ordinarily
	  operates in full-duplex mode.	 Characters may	be typed at
	  any time, even while output is occurring, and	are only lost
	  when the system character input buffers become completely
	  full,	which is rare, or when the user	has accumulated	the
	  maximum allowed number of input characters that have not yet
	  been read by some program.  Currently, this limit is 256
	  characters.  When the	input limit is reached,	all the	saved
	  characters are thrown	away without notice.

	  Normally, terminal input is processed	in units of lines.  A
	  line is delimited by

	     - a new-line (ASCII LF) character
	     - an end-of-file (ASCII EOT) character
	     - an end-of-line character

	  This means that a program attempting to read is suspended
	  until	an entire line has been	typed.	Also, no matter	how
	  many characters are requested	in the read call, at most one
	  line is returned.  It	is not,	however, necessary to read a
	  whole	line at	once; any number of characters may be
	  requested in a read, even one, without losing	information.

	  When one or more characters are written, they	are

	  transmitted to the terminal as soon as previously-written
	  characters have finished typing.  Input characters are
	  echoed by putting them in the	output queue as	they arrive.
	  If a process produces	characters more	rapidly	than they can
	  be typed, the	process	is suspended when its output queue
	  exceeds some limit.  When the	queue has drained down to some
	  threshold, the program is resumed.

	  During input,	erase and kill processing is normally done.
	  By default:

	       the character #### erases the last character typed,	except
	       that it does not	erase beyond the beginning of the line

	       the character @@@@ kills (deletes) the entire input	line,
	       and optionally outputs a	new-line character

	  Both these characters	operate	on a key-stroke	basis,
	  independently	of any backspacing or tabbing that may have
	  been done.  Both the erase and kill characters may be
	  entered literally by preceding them with the escape
	  character (\\\\).  In this case the escape character is not
	  read.	 The erase and kill characters may be changed.

	  Certain characters have special functions on input.  These
	  functions and	their default character	values are summarized
	  as follows:

	  INTR	  (Rubout or ASCII DEL)	generates an _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t signal
		  which	is sent	to all processes with the associated
		  control terminal.  Normally, each such process is
		  forced to terminate, but arrangements	may be made
		  either to ignore the signal or to receive a trap to
		  an agreed-upon location; see _s_i_g_n_a_l(2).

	  QUIT	  (Control-| or	ASCII FS) generates a _q_u_i_t signal.
		  Its treatment	is identical to	the interrupt signal
		  except that, unless a	receiving process has made
		  other	arrangements, it is not	only terminated	but a
		  core image file (called ccccoooorrrreeee)	is created in the
		  current working directory.

	  SWTCH	  (Control-z or	ASCII SUB) is used by the job control
		  facility, _s_h_l, to change the current layer to	the
		  control layer.

	  ERASE	  (#) erases the preceding character.  It does not
		  erase	beyond the start of a line, as delimited by a
		  NL, EOF, or EOL character.

	  KILL	  (@) deletes the entire line, as delimited by a NL,
		  EOF, or EOL character.

	  EOF	  (Control-d or	ASCII EOT) may be used to generate an
		  end-of-file from a terminal.	When received, all the
		  characters waiting to	be read	are immediately	passed
		  to the program, without waiting for a	new-line, and
		  the EOF is discarded.	 Thus, if there	are no
		  characters waiting (which is to say the EOF occurred
		  at the beginning of a	line), zero characters are
		  passed back, which is	the standard end-of-file
		  indication.

	  NL	  (ASCII LF) is	the normal line	delimiter.  It can not
		  be changed or	escaped.

	  EOL	  (ASCII NUL) is an additional line delimiter, like
		  NL.  It is not normally used.

	  STOP	  (Control-s or	ASCII DC3) can be used to temporarily
		  suspend output.  It is useful	with CRT terminals to
		  prevent output from disappearing before it can be
		  read.	 While output is suspended, STOP characters
		  are ignored and not read.

	  START	  (Control-q or	ASCII DC1) is used to resume output
		  which	has been suspended by a	STOP character.	 While
		  output is not	suspended, START characters are
		  ignored and not read.	 The start/stop	characters can
		  not be changed or escaped.

	  The character	values for INTR, QUIT, ERASE, KILL, EOF, and
	  EOL may be changed to	suit individual	tastes.	 The ERASE,
	  KILL,	and EOF	characters may be escaped by a preceding \\\\
	  character, in	which case no special function is done.

	  When the carrier signal from the data-set drops, a _h_a_n_g_u_p
	  signal is sent to all	processes that have this terminal as
	  the control terminal.	 Unless	other arrangements have	been
	  made,	this signal causes the processes to terminate.	If the
	  hangup signal	is ignored, any	subsequent read	returns	with
	  an end-of-file indication.  Thus programs that read a
	  terminal and test for	end-of-file can	terminate
	  appropriately	when hung up on.

				 parity	errors.
	       EXTEND  0100000	Enable processing of ASCII SO and
				 ASCII SI.

	  The initial input control value is all bits clear.

	  IGNBRK, BRKINT, IGNPAR
	       If IGNBRK is set, the break condition (a	character
	       framing error with data all zeros) is ignored, that is,
	       not put on the input queue and therefore	not read by
	       any process.  Otherwise if BRKINT is set, the break

	       condition generates an interrupt	signal and flush both
	       the input and output queues.  If	IGNPAR is set,
	       characters with other framing and parity	errors are
	       ignored.

	  PARMRK
	       If PARMRK is set, a character with a framing or parity
	       error which is not ignored is read as the three
	       character sequence: 0377, 0, X, where X is the data of
	       the character received in error.	 To avoid ambiguity in
	       this case, if ISTRIP is not set,	a valid	character of
	       0377 is read as 0377, 0377.  If PARMRK is not set, a
	       framing or parity error which is	not ignored is read as
	       the character NUL (0).

	  INPCK
	       If INPCK	is set,	input parity checking is enabled.  If
	       INPCK is	not set, input parity checking is disabled.
	       This allows output parity generation without input
	       parity errors.

	  ISTRIP
	       If ISTRIP is set, valid input characters	are first
	       stripped	to 7-bits, otherwise all 8-bits	are processed.

	  INLCR, IGNCR,	ICRNL
	       If INLCR	is set,	a received NL character	is translated
	       into a CR character.  If	IGNCR is set, a	received CR
	       character is ignored (not read).	 Otherwise if ICRNL is
	       set, a received CR character is translated into a NL
	       character.

	  IUCLC
	       If IUCLC	is set,	a received upper-case alphabetic
	       character is translated into the	corresponding lower-
	       case character.

	  IXON,	IXANY
	       If IXON is set, start/stop output control is enabled.
	       A received STOP character suspends output and a
	       received	START character	restarts output.  All
	       start/stop characters are ignored and not read.	If
	       IXANY is	set, any input character restarts output which
	       has been	suspended.

	  IXOFF
	       If IXOFF	is set,	the system transmits START/STOP
	       characters when the input queue is nearly empty/full.

	  IRTS If IRTS is set, the system sets/resets the request-to-
	       send signal when	the input queue	is nearly empty/full.

	  ERR_BEL
	       If ERR_BEL is set, the system transmits the ASCII BEL
	       whenever	an input error is detected.  If	IGNBRK,
	       IGNPAR, or INPCK	is set,	the ASCII BEL is not
	       transmitted for those cases that	are to be ignored.

	  EXTEND
	       If EXTEND is set, the system processes the ASCII	SO and
	       ASCII SI	characters for an extended character set.  On
	       input all 7-bit characters delimited by SI and SO are
	       mapped to 8-bit characters, and correspondingly,	on
	       output the 7-bit	representations	of the characters is
	       transmitted, delimiting all character sequences in
	       which the 8th bit is set	by SI and SO characters.

	       Note that the EXTEND flag should	not be set if the
	       XCASE flag is set, indicating upper case	to lower case
	       conversion.

	  The initial output control value is all bits clear.

	  OPOST
	       If OPOST	is set,	output characters are post-processed
	       as indicated by the remaining flags, otherwise
	       characters are transmitted without change.

	  OLCUC
	       If OLCUC	is set,	a lower-case alphabetic	character is
	       transmitted as the corresponding	upper-case character.
	       This function is	often used in conjunction with IUCLC.

	  ONLCR, OCRNL,	ONOCR, ONLRET
	       If ONLCR	is set,	the NL character is transmitted	as the
	       CR-NL character pair.

	       If OCRNL	is set,	the CR character is transmitted	as the
	       NL character.

	       If ONOCR	is set,	no CR character	is transmitted when at
	       column 0	(first position).

	       If ONLRET is set, the NL	character is assumed to	do the
	       carriage-return function; the column pointer is set to
	       0 and the delays	specified for CR is used.

	       Otherwise the NL	character is assumed to	do just	the
	       line-feed function; the column pointer remains
	       unchanged.

	       The column pointer is also set to 0 if the CR character
	       is actually transmitted.

	  The delay bits specify how long transmission stops to	allow
	  for mechanical or other movement when	certain	characters are
	  sent to the terminal.	 In all	cases a	value of 0 indicates
	  no delay.

	  If OFILL is set, fill	characters are transmitted for delay
	  instead of a timed delay.  This is useful for	high baud rate
	  terminals which need only a minimal delay.

	  If OFDEL is set, the fill character is DEL, otherwise	NUL.

	  If a form-feed or vertical-tab delay is specified, it	lasts
	  for about 2 seconds.

	  New-line delay lasts about 0.10 seconds.

	  If ONLRET is set, the	carriage-return	delays are used
	  instead of the new-line delays.

	  If OFILL is set, two fill characters are transmitted.

	  Carriage-return delay	type 1 is dependent on the current
	  column position, type	2 is about 0.10	seconds, and type 3 is
	  about	0.15 seconds.

	  If OFILL is set, delay type 1	transmits two fill characters,
	  and type 2 four fill characters.

	  Horizontal-tab delay type 1 is dependent on the current
	  column position.  Type 2 is about 0.10 seconds.  Type	3
	  specifies that tabs are to be	expanded into spaces.

	  Backspace delay lasts	about 0.05 seconds.  If	OFILL is set,
	  one fill character is	transmitted.

	  The actual delays depend on line speed and system load.

	       HDX     0040000	Half-duplex mode.

	  The initial hardware control value after open	is B9600, CS7,
	  CREAD, PARENB, HUPCL.

	  CBAUD
	       The CBAUD bits specify the baud rate.  The zero baud
	       rate, B0, is used to hang up the	connection.  If	B0 is
	       specified, the data-terminal-ready signal is not
	       asserted.  Normally, this disconnects the line.	For
	       any particular hardware,	impossible speed changes are
	       ignored.

	  CSIZE, CSTOPB
	       The CSIZE bits specify the character size in bits for
	       both transmission and reception.	 This size does	not
	       include the parity bit, if any.	If CSTOPB is set, two
	       stop bits are used, otherwise one stop bit.  For
	       example,	at 110 baud, two stops bits are	required.

	  PARENB
	       If PARENB is set, parity	generation and detection is
	       enabled and a parity bit	is added to each character.
	       If parity is enabled, the PARODD	flag specifies odd
	       parity if set, otherwise	even parity is used.

	  CREAD
	       If CREAD	is set,	the receiver is	enabled.  Otherwise no
	       characters are received.

	  HUPCL
	       If HUPCL	is set,	the line is disconnected when the last
	       process with the	line open closes it or terminates.
	       That is,	the data-terminal-ready	signal is not
	       asserted.

	  CLOCAL
	       If CLOCAL is set, the line is assumed to	be a local,
	       direct connection with no modem control.	 Otherwise
	       modem control is	assumed.

	  LOBLK
	       If LOBLK	is set,	the output of a	job control layer is
	       blocked when it is not the current layer. Otherwise,
	       the output from that layer is multiplexed onto the
	       current layer.

	  REVS_CH
	       If REVS_CH is set, the reverse channel(secondary
	       clear-to-send) signal controls the transmitter in
	       addition	to the clear-to-send signal.  This is
	       effective only on the last 2 ports of an	HPSIO module.

	  HDX  If HDX is set, the RS-232 conventions for a half-duplex
	       device like a Bell 202 modem are	followed.  HDX should
	       not be used with	IRTS and IXON because unpredictable
	       results may occur.

	  The _c__l_f_l_a_g field of the argument structure is used by the
	  line discipline to control terminal functions.  The basic
	  line discipline (0) provides the following:

	       ISIG    0000001	Enable signals.
	       ICANON  0000002	Canonical input	(erase and kill
				 processing).
	       XCASE   0000004	Canonical upper/lower presentation.
	       ECHO    0000010	Enable echo.
	       ECHOE   0000020	Echo erase character as	BS-SP-BS.
	       ECHOK   0000040	Echo NL	after kill character.
	       ECHONL  0000100	Echo NL.
	       NOFLSH  0000200	Disable	flush after interrupt or quit.

	  The initial line-discipline control value is all bits	clear.

	  ISIG
	       If ISIG is set, each input character is checked against
	       the special control characters INTR, SWTCH, and QUIT.
	       If an input character matches one of these control
	       characters, the function	associated with	that character
	       is performed.  If ISIG is not set, no checking is done.
	       Thus these special input	functions are possible only if
	       ISIG is set.

	       These functions may be disabled individually by
	       changing	the value of the control character to an
	       unlikely	or impossible value (e.g. 0377).

	  ICANON
	       If ICANON is set, canonical processing is enabled.
	       This enables the	erase and kill edit functions, and the
	       assembly	of input characters into lines delimited by
	       NL, EOF,	and EOL.

	       If ICANON is not	set, read requests are satisfied
	       directly	from the input queue.  A read is not satisfied
	       until at	least MIN characters have been received	or the
	       timeout value TIME has expired between characters.
	       This allows fast	bursts of input	to be read efficiently
	       while still allowing single character input.

	       The MIN and TIME	values are stored in the position for
	       the EOF and EOL characters respectively.	 The time
	       value represents	tenths of seconds.

	  XCASE
	       If XCASE	is set,	and if ICANON is set, an upper-case
	       letter is accepted on input by preceding	it with	a \\\\
	       character, and is output	preceded by a \\\\	character.  In
	       this mode, the following	escape sequences are generated
	       on output and accepted on input:

	       _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r	_e_s_c_a_p_e _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e

		    }}}}		     \\\\))))
		    \\\\		     \\\\\\\\

	  For example, AAAA is input as \\\\aaaa, \\\\nnnn as \\\\\\\\nnnn, and	\\\\NNNN as \\\\\\\\\\\\nnnn.

	  ECHO
	       If ECHO is set, characters are echoed as	received.

	  NOFLSH
	       If NOFLSH is set, the normal flush of the input and
	       output queues associated	with the quit, switch, and
	       interrupt characters is not done.

	EEEEcccchhhhoooo ffffuuuunnnnccccttttiiiioooonnnnssss
	  When ICANON is set, the following echo functions are
	  possible.

	  If ECHO and ECHOE are	set, the erase character is echoed as
	  ASCII	BS SP BS, which	clears the last	character from a CRT
	  screen.

	  If ECHOE is set and ECHO is not set, the erase character is
	  echoed as ASCII SP BS.

	  If ECHOK is set, the NL character is echoed after the	kill
	  character to emphasize that the line will be deleted.

	  Note that an escape character	preceding the erase or kill
	  character removes any	special	function.

	  If ECHONL is set, the	NL character is	echoed even if ECHO is
	  not set.  This is useful for terminals set to	local echo
	  (so-called half duplex).

	  Unless escaped, the EOF character is not echoed.  Because
	  EOT is the default EOF character, this prevents terminals
	  that respond to EOT from hanging up.

	       struct termio *arg;

	  The commands using this form are:

	       TCGETA	 Get the parameters associated with the
			 terminal and store in the _t_e_r_m_i_o structure
			 referenced by aaaarrrrgggg.

	       TCSETA	 Set the parameters associated with the

			 aaaarrrrgggg.  The change is immediate.

	       TCSETAW	 Wait for the output to	drain before setting
			 the new parameters.  This form	should be used
			 when changing parameters that affect output.

	       TCSETAF	 Wait for the output to	drain, then flush the
			 input queue and set the new parameters.

	  Additional _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls have the form:

	       ioctl (fildes, command, arg)
	       int arg;

	  The commands using this form are:

	       TCSBRK	 Wait for the output to	drain.	If _a_r_g is 0,
			 then send a break (zero bits for 0.25
			 seconds).

	       TCXONC	 Start/stop control.  If _a_r_g is	0, suspend
			 output; if 1, restart suspended output.

	       TCFLSH	 If _a_r_g	is 0, flush the	input queue; if	1,
			 flush the output queue; if 2, flush both the
			 input and output queues.
