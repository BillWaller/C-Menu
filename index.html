<h2>New FAQ Added</h2>
<a href="doc/FAQ.html">C-Menu FAQ</a><br>
<h2>Programs: C-Menu Menu, Form, Pick, View, and RSH</h2>
<p>C-Menu is a lightweight, customizable, and easy-to-learn suite of programs
for creating menus, entry forms, and pickers with a text-based user
interface(TUI) for applications running on Linux and Unix-like operating
systems. C-Menu is designed to be simple to use while providing powerful
features to implement menu driven frameworks for applications in
terminal and terminal emulator environments.</p>
<h3>C-Menu</h3>
<img src="screenshots/applications_menu.m.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Menu" />
<p>C-Menu reads a simple description file like the one above and displays a menu to the user. When the user selects an item, with either keyboard or mouse, C-Menu executes the corresponding command. It's like writing a shell script, but with a nice TUI menu interface.</p>
<img src="screenshots/applications_menu.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Menu" />
<p>From the above examples, you can get an idea of how C-Menu works. Examine line-21 in &quot;main.m&quot; above. C-Menu Menu starts C-Menu View, which in turn executes &quot;tree-sitter highlight view_engine.c&quot;. Tree-Sitter doesn't need to know anything about C-Menu View. It just sends output to it's standard output device, which happens to be a pipe set up by C-Menu View. C-Menu View maps Tree-Sitter's output to the Kernel's demand paged virtual memory and you get:</p>
<img src="screenshots/tree-sitter.png" alt="Tree-Sitter" title="Tree Sitter" />
<h3>C-Menu C-Keys - Diagnose Keyboard/Mouse Input</h3>
<p>C-Menu C-Keys is a diagnostic tool that helps you resolve keyboard and mouse issues quickly. Just press a key and get the Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal, the ANSI escape sequence binding, or the NCURSES identifier. It's definately easier than rummaging through hardware documentation and NCurses header files. It's also a good way to identify which keys are reserved by your terminal emulator, and gives you the specific key codes so you can easily add your own Extended NCurses keys.</p>
<img src="screenshots/extended-keys.png" alt="Extended Keys" title="Extended Keys" />
<img src="screenshots/ckeys-alt.png" alt="CKeys ALT Keys" title="CKeys ALT Keys" />
<p>C-Menu C-Keys also provides a diagnostic capability for mouse actions and geometry.</p>
<img src="screenshots/ckeys-mouse.png" alt="CKeys Mouse" title="CKeys Mouse" />
<p>Just add hot water, stir, and Bob's your uncle, you have soup!</p>
<h3>C-Menu PICK</h3>
<img src="screenshots/Pick.png" />
<p>This program provides a list of objects from arguments, piped input, or a text file and lets the user select those to be written to a file, piped to standard output, or provided as arguments to an executable specified in the description file. Of course, you can select objects and commands with keyboard or mouse. C-Menu Pick does not currently support a Brain-Computer Interface. At least, not
Yet.</p>
<p>The simplest use of C-Menu Pick is:</p>
<p>Pick a file to view:</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>view -S &quot;lf -r . .*\.c$&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Execute a script on a picked file:</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>pick -S &quot;lf -r . .*\.c$&quot; -n 1 -c my_executable
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the syntax for &quot;lf&quot; (list files) is not similar to Unix &quot;ls&quot;. The usage of &quot;lf&quot; is:</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>lf [directory] [regular expression]
</code></pre>
<p>If you type &quot;lf *.c&quot;, it will fail for lack of a valid regular expression. &quot;ls&quot; uses shell expansion, and &quot;lf&quot; uses regular expressions. &quot;lf&quot; is a simple utility that comes with C-Menu. You could just as easily use find to accomplish the same result, and find accepts &quot;*.c&quot;, even though it isn't a valid regular expression.</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>find . -name '*.c' | sed 's/^..//'
</code></pre>
<p>Create a list of objects</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>grep &quot;regex&quot; *.rs | pick -o objectlist
</code></pre>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>vi ~/.config/bat/config

add

--pager=view

save and type:

bat view_engine.c
</code></pre>
<h3>C-Menu FORM</h3>
<p>FORM is a lightweight and flexible form handling library designed to simplify the process of creating, validating, and managing forms.</p>
<p>It provides a straightforward API for defining form fields, handling user input, and performing validation checks.</p>
<h3>C-Menu FORM Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy Form Creation: Define forms with various field types such as text, number, email, and more.</li>
<li>Validation: Built-in validation rules to ensure data integrity, including required fields, format checks, and custom validators.</li>
<li>User Input Handling: Seamlessly capture and process user input from the command line or text-based interfaces.</li>
<li>Customizable: Extendable architecture allowing developers to create custom field types and validation rules.</li>
<li>Integration: Designed to work well with other components of the C-Menu Project, enabling a cohesive development experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>C-Menu FORM Data Types</h3>
<img src="screenshots/data-types.f.png" />
<img src="screenshots/data-types.png" />
<p>FORM displays data entry forms based on a description file. It allows users
to input data in a structured manner. The entered data can then be processed
by a specified command or script. Internally, the numeric entries are converted to binary integer, long, float, or double.</p>
<img src="screenshots/Receipt.png" />
<p>The two Cash Receipts entry forms above are identical except the top form has field brackets turned on and the bottom form has fill characters set to underscore. This is a simple configuration option from the command line or the configuration file.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, in the form description syntax, as I did below, you will
get a notification pinpointing the problem. In this message, we can see that the
format field on line 3 of &quot;receipt.f&quot; is invalid. I have a &quot;3&quot;, and it should have been &quot;String&quot;. The corrected line would be: &quot;F!2!18!10!String&quot;.</p>
<img src="screenshots/form-error.png" />
<p>Need quick and easy Cash Receipts, General Journal, or wedding invitation
list? FORM has you covered. The application shown above took about 10
minutes from design to test. It doesn't post transactions, or keep running
balances yet, but that's why we have people like you.</p>
<p>FORM also makes a great front-end for SQL database queries.</p>
<h3>C-Menu Sample Menu Description File</h3>
<img src="screenshots/applications_menu.m.png" alt="Menu Description File log" title="Menu Description File" />
<p>As you can see, the description file is straightforward and easy to read. Each menu item consists of a label and a command to execute. The label is displayed in the menu, and the command is executed when the user selects that item.</p>
<img src="screenshots/pick-edit.png" alt="Pick Edit Files" title="Pick Edit File" />
<p>Here's just one example of how easy it is to create useful programs with the C-Menu Form facility.</p>
<img src="screenshots/iloan_f.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Application" />
<img src="screenshots/iloan.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Application" />
<p>We hope you find C-Menu useful for your projects. It's a powerful tool that can
greatly simplify the process of creating text-based user interfaces for
your applications.</p>
<h3>C-Menu VIEW</h3>
<p>VIEW is an easy-to-use text file viewer that allows users to view text files in a
terminal environment. It supports basic navigation, regular expression
search functionality, horizontal scrolling, ANSI escape highlighting, Unicode, and
NCurses wide characters. VIEW can be invoked from within MENU, FORM, or PICK to provide contextual help or stand-alone, full-screen as a system pager.</p>
<h4>Nvim Screenshot</h4>
<img src="screenshots/nvim-log.png" alt="nvim log" title="nvim log" />
<h4>CMenu Screenshot of the Same File</h4>
<img src="screenshots/view.png" alt="View" title="View" />
<p>One especially useful feature of C-Menu View is its incredible speed with large text files, like system logs. C-Menu View can open and display multi-gigabyte text files almost instantaneously. Seek from beginning to end of a 1Gb file takes a few milliseconds.</p>
<h3>C-Menu View and Manual Pages</h3>
<p>C-Menu View can also be used as a pager for manual pages. By setting the
&quot;MANPAGER&quot; environment variable to &quot;view&quot;, users can enjoy the benefits of
C-Menu View's features while reading manual pages. However, setting MANPAGER=&quot;Nvim !Man+&quot; is my recommendation. I don't know what Nvim is using to colorize manual pages, but it looks great. The most compelling reason to use Nvim is that it's very easy to write a few lines to a file, or edit the file, if you like.</p>
<p>If you still want to use C-Menu View as your MANPAGER, just add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc):</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>    export PAGER=&quot;view&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also filter manual pages through ~/menuapp/msrc/man.sed to colorize underlined,emboldened, and italicized text. This sed script is included with C-Menu. To use it, you can run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>    man -Tutf8 bash.ls | sed -f ~/menuapp/msrc/man.sed | view
</code></pre>
<h3>Example Neovim Manual Page</h3>
<img src="screenshots/nvim-man-page.png" title="Nvim Man Page" />
<h3>Example C-Menu View Manual Page</h3>
<img src="screenshots/man-page.png" title="C-Menu View Man Page" />
<p>The C-Menu View manual page with the sed filter looks pretty good, but the functionality and smooth interface is not quite there yet. That's a good project for an enterprising programmer with some time on his hands <hint>.</p>
<h3>C-Menu View Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using seek and read operations on a complicated buffering system, C-Menu View leverages the Kernel's sophisticated demand paged virtual memory.</li>
<li>Lazy loading means that the program doesn't waste time seeking, reading, and populating buffers that will not be needed.</li>
<li>Simplicity - Files are mapped onto the Kernel's virtual memory address space and leveraging the Kernel's sophisticated demand paged virtual memory.</li>
<li>Zero-Copy I/O - Using &quot;mmap&quot;, C-Menu View reads directly from virtual memory, without having to copy blocks from the file-system into heap address space.</li>
<li>Simplicity - A picture is worth lots of words. No reads, no seeks, no buffer management schemes, at lest not for view. It's all handled by the kernel. The following snippet includes all of View's file I/O.</li>
</ul>
<img src="screenshots/file-io.png" alt="nvim log" title="nvim log" />
<h3>C-Menu 3-Channel Gamma Correction</h3>
<p>When using utilities such as &quot;tree-sitter highlighter&quot;, &quot;pygmentize&quot;, or &quot;bat&quot; to highlight files, the text is sometimes almost unreadable. On the left-hand side of the following screenshot, &quot;less&quot; does a great job of rendering the output of pygmentize, but C-Menu with gamma correction can do better. It's all about perceptual luminance. Either from the command line or the minitrc file, the user can specify a gamma correction value for each of the three color channels, red, green, and blue. It's a minor thing, really, but we programmers aren't &quot;automitons.&quot; A pleasing visual appearance makes work more fun.</p>

<h4>That's a Bobby Dazzler!</h4>
<p>(Australian TV show)</p>
<p>With Unicode glyphs, ANSI escape highlighting, and 3-Channel gamma correction, your application is bound to <strong>Wow</strong> your clients. Nobody wants an ugly program. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That's why we give you control.</p>
<h3>RSH</h3>
<img src="screenshots/rsh.png" />
<p>Despite its name, RSH is not a shell. It is a shell runner, which allows
you to specify your shell of choice, and provides a consistent environment
for running shell scripts and commands. RSH was designed to be invoked from
within MENU, FORM, or PICK to execute commands that require elevated
privileges, but its functionality extends beyond that.</p>
<p>You can execute commands in either user or root mode, making it a versatile
tool for developing aplication front-ends. RSH ensures that your scripts
and executables run in a controlled environment, reducing the chances of
unexpected behavior due to differing shell environments. RSH forks and waits
for its spawn to complete before returning control to the calling program.
When executed under C-Menu's signal handler, it catches and displays the
exit status of the command, allowing for better error handling. Instead of
using su -c or sudo to run commands as root, you can use rsh -c to achieve
the same result in a more streamlined manner. You can literally have root
access within a fraction of a second, making it ideal for work that
requires frequent switching between user and root modes for various
administrative tasks.</p>
<p>Many system administrators and developers find RSH invaluable for tasks
that require elevated privileges. RSH eliminates the need to repeatedly enter
passwords or switch users, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency. We all know it's not a good idea to run everything as root, but sometimes a user want's to avoid precious seconds it takes to enter passwords for su. With RSH, it takes three keystrokes to enter root mode and two keystrokes to get out.</p>
<h4>RSH With &quot;make install&quot;</h4>
<p>Here's an example of the proper way to use RSH.</p>
<ol>
<li>Type &quot;xx&quot; to assume root privileges.</li>
<li>Type &quot;make install&quot;</li>
<li>Type &quot;x&quot; to relinquish root privileges.</li>
</ol>
<img src="screenshots/Makefile-out.png" alt="Makefile" title="RSH with make install" />
<p>Notice that the bash prompt changes from green to red as a reminder that you are wielding a loaded gun with the safety off. In this state, it only takes a minor typo, such as:</p>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>rm -r tmp/*
</code></pre>
<p>Please be very careful when using RSH in setuid root mode. Keep the
executable protected in your home directory with appropriate permissions
to prevent promiscuous access by unauthorized users. RSH should be provided
only to trusted users who understand the implications of executing commands
with elevated privileges. Used inappropriately, it can lead to system
instability or security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>As an interesting note, you can accomplish basically the same functionality in 9 lines of Rust by using the 'pub unsafe extern &quot;C&quot; fn setuid(uid: uid_t) -&gt; c_int' function in Rust. Of course, that isn't really in the spirit of Rust, is it?</p>
