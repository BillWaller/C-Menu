<h2>Programs: Menu, Form, Pick, View, and RSH</h2>
<p>CMENU is a lightweight, customizable, and easy-to-learn suite of programs
for creating menus, entry forms, and pickers with a text-based user
interface(TUI) for applications running on Linux and Unix-like operating
systems. CMENU is designed to be simple to use while providing powerful
features to implement menu driven frameworks for applications in
terminal and terminal emulator environments.</p>
<h3>CMENU</h3>
<img src="screenshots/sample_menu.m.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Menu" />
<p>MENU reads a simple description file like the one above and displays a menu to the user. When the user selects an item, MENU executes the corresponding command. It's like writing a shell script, but with a nice TUI menu interface.</p>
<h3>Test Curses Keys</h3>
<p>Is a particular key not working for your project? Curses Keys (or CKeys)
provides an easy way to determine whether the problem is with your code
or your terminfo/termcap files. Or, if you just don't remember the key
symbol for Curses. It also gives you the Octal, Decimal, and Hex codes
for keys not defined in Curses, so you can provide your own custom keys.</p>
<img src="screenshots/Curses_Keys.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Curses Keys" />
<h3>CMENU with PICK</h3>
<img src="screenshots/Pick.png" />
<p>This program provides a list of objects from arguments or a text file
and lets the user select any number to be written to a file or provided
as arguments to an executable specified in the description file.</p>
<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>FORM is a lightweight and flexible form handling library designed to simplify the process of creating, validating, and managing forms in text-based applications.</p>
<p>It provides a straightforward API for defining form fields, handling user input, and performing validation checks.</p>
<h3>FORM Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy Form Creation: Define forms with various field types such as text, number, email, and more.</li>
<li>Validation: Built-in validation rules to ensure data integrity, including required fields, format checks, and custom validators.</li>
<li>User Input Handling: Seamlessly capture and process user input from the command line or text-based interfaces.</li>
<li>Customizable: Extendable architecture allowing developers to create custom field types and validation rules.</li>
<li>Integration: Designed to work well with other components of the C-Menu Project, enabling a cohesive development experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FORM Data Types</h3>
<img src="screenshots/data-types.f.png" />
<img src="screenshots/data-types.png" />
<p>FORM displays data entry forms based on a description file. It allows users
to input data in a structured manner. The entered data can then be processed
by a specified command or script.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, in the form description syntax, as I did below, you will
get a notification pinpointing the problem. In this message, we can see that the
format field on line 3 of &quot;receipt.f&quot; is invalid. I have a &quot;3&quot;, and it should have been &quot;String&quot;. The corrected line would be: &quot;F!2!18!10!String&quot;.</p>
<img src="screenshots/form-error.png" />
<p>Decision, Inc. used CMENU's FORM program to augment it's Radio Broadcast
accounting, scheduling and management system. It was particularly useful
as a front-end for our SQL database applications.</p>
<img src="screenshots/Receipt.png" />
<p>Need quick and easy Cash Receipts, General Journal, or wedding invitation
list? FORM has you covered. The application shown above took about 10
minutes from design to test. It doesn't post transactions, or keep running
balances yet, but that's why we have people like you.</p>
<p>FORM also makes a great front-end for SQL database queries.</p>
<h3>A Sample Menu Description File</h3>
<pre class="rounded-code"><code>H:SAMPLE MENU

:Gnumeric
!exec gnumeric

:Shell Script
!exec bash -c script.sh

:Shell Script as Root
!exec rsh -c script.sh

:Full Screen (root) Shell
!exec rsh

:Test Curses Keys
!ckeys

:Pick Items From a List
!pick -i picklist -M -c vi picklist.out

:Cash Receipts
!form receipt.d -c receipt.sh

:Help
!help ~/menuapp/doc/applications.hlp

:Exit Applications
!return
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the description file is straightforward and easy to read. Each menu item consists of a label and a command to execute. The label is displayed in the menu, and the command is executed when the user selects that item.</p>
<p>Here's just one example of how easy it is to create useful programs with the C-Menu Form facility.</p>
<img src="screenshots/iloan_f.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Application" />
<img src="screenshots/iloan.png" alt="Curses Keys" title="Sample Application" />
<p>We hope you find CMENU useful for your projects. It's a powerful tool that can
greatly simplify the process of creating text-based user interfaces for
your applications.</p>
<h3>VIEW</h3>
<p>VIEW is an easy-to-use text file viewer that allows users to view text files in a
terminal environment. It supports basic navigation, regular expression
search functionality, horizontal scrolling, ANSI escape highlighting, Unicode, and
NCurses wide characters. VIEW can be invoked from within MENU, FORM, or PICK to provide contextual help or stand-alone, full-screen as a system pager.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that Nvim doesn't render ANSI escape sequences. Why should it? How often do you need to edit a file with ANSI escape sequences? Generally, the user just needs to view that type of file, and that's what pagers like &quot;less&quot; and C-Menu view were designed to do.</p>
<h4>Nvim Screenshot</h4>
<img src="screenshots/nvim-log.png" alt="nvim log" title="nvim log" />
<h4>C-Menu View Screenshot</h4>
<img src="screenshots/view.png" alt="View" title="View" />
<p>One especially useful feature of C-Menu View is its incredible speed with large
text files, like system logs. C-Menu View can open and display multi-gigabyte text files almost instantaneously. While NVIM and other modern editors are outstanding for code editing, but don't even try to open multi-gigabyte file with them. C-Menu View handles large files without breaking a sweat, and zips through them with lightning speed.</p>
<h4>view ~/menuapp/help/view.help</h4>
<img src="screenshots/view-help.png" alt="View Help" title="View Help" />
<p>Or maybe you just want to have Unicode glyphs and ANSI escape highlighting in
your documentation.</p>
<p>Here's the C-Menu description. As you can see, the view command on line 24 specifies the number of columns and lines (-C and -L respectively).</p>
<img src="screenshots/main.m.png" />
<h3>RSH</h3>
<img src="screenshots/rsh.png" />
<p>Despite its name, RSH is not a shell. It is a shell runner, which allows
you to specify your shell of choice, and provides a consistent environment
for running shell scripts and commands. RSH was designed to be invoked from
within MENU, FORM, or PICK to execute commands that require elevated
privileges, but its functionality extends beyond that.</p>
<p>You can execute commands in either user or root mode, making it a versatile
tool for developing aplication front-ends. RSH ensures that your scripts
and executables run in a controlled environment, reducing the chances of
unexpected behavior due to differing shell environments. RSH forks and waits
for its spawn to complete before returning control to the calling program.
When executed under CMenu's signal handler, it catches and displays the
exit status of the command, allowing for better error handling. Instead of
using su -c or sudo to run commands as root, you can use rsh -c to achieve
the same result in a more streamlined manner. You can literally have root
access within a fraction of a second, making it ideal for work that
requires frequent switching between user and root modes for various
administrative tasks.</p>
<p>Many system administrators and developers find RSH invaluable for tasks
that require elevated privileges. RSH eliminates the need to repeatedly enter
passwords or switch users, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency. We all
know it's not a good idea to run everything as root, but sometimes a user want's to
avoid precious seconds it takes to enter passwords for su. With RSH, it takes three
keystrokes to enter root mode and two keystrokes to get out.</p>
<p>Please be very careful when using RSH in setuid root mode. Keep the
executable protected in your home directory with appropriate permissions
to prevent promiscuous access by unauthorized users. RSH should be provided
only to trusted users who understand the implications of executing commands
with elevated privileges. Used inappropriately, it can lead to system
instability or security vulnerabilities.</p>
