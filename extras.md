## Installing Rust

C-Menu is written in C, but there are many amazing tools written in Rust that
can augment your experience using C-Menu. Even if you never plan to write code
in rust, the Cargo package manager that comes with Rust is worth the effort to
install Rust. Cargo is generally the easiest and most reliable way to install
Rust-based tools and their dependencies. Below are instructions on how to
install Rust and some of my favorite Rust-based tools.

### Installing Rust On Linux and macOS

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.

```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

For more detailed instructions, visit

[the official Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

After installation, ensure that your environment is set up correctly by running:

```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

You can verify the installation by checking the Rust version:

```bash
    rustc --version
```

This should display the installed Rust version, confirming that Rust is
successfully installed on your system.

You can update Rust and Cargo at any time by running:

```bash
    rustup update
```

## About C-Menu and R-Menu

Eventually, if there is enough interest in C-Menu, it will be ported to Rust.
The plan is to thoroughly test and debug the C version, and incrementally
incorporate Rust-like coding paradigms into the C codebase. Once the C version
is stable and feature complete, we begin the porting process, we will begin
refactoring C-Menu to use more modular code structures and rust-like paradigms
that will facilitate the eventual port to Rust.

Come along with us on this exciting journey. If you already know Rust, we
could use your help. If you don't know Rust, you can learn with us.
You can contribute to R-Menu's evolution, and get involved in the Rust
community. Add Rust to your CV or Resume.

And, then you can say, you were a part of the team that created R-Menu. 😀

## Installing Bat

Bat is a popular Rust-based tool that serves as a cat clone with syntax
highlighting. It's easier to install and accommodates a variety of file
types not addressed by Tree-Sitter, and. To install Bat, use the following
commands based on your operating system:

### Bat On Linux

After installing Rust, you can install Bat using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
    cargo install bat
```

### Bat On macOS

```bash
    brew install bat
```

## Installing Ripgrep

Ripgrep is a modernized and powerful replacement for grep. It is amazingly fast
and incorporates many features not available in grep.

To install Ripgrep, you can use the following commands depending on your
operating system

### Ripgrep On Linux

After installing Rust, you can install Ripgrep using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
    cargo install ripgrep
```

### Ripgrep On macOS

```bash
    brew install ripgrep
```

## lsd

To install lsd, a modern replacement for 'ls' with colorful output and additional
features, you can use the following commands based on your operating system:

### lsd On Linux

After installing Rust, you can install lsd using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
    cargo install lsd
```

### lsd On macOS

```bash
    brew install lsd
```

```powershell
    choco install lsd
```

After installation, you can verify that lsd is installed correctly by running:

```bash
    lsd --version
```

This should display the installed lsd version, confirming that lsd is successfully
installed on your system.

A word of caution here, "lsd"" in a different context, is an acronym for a
powerful hallucinogenic drug. Don't casually tell your grandmother you have
been using lsd without explaining that it's the Deluxe version of "ls", a
file listing utility, and not the "lsd" she remembers from her college days. 😵‍💫

## Tree-Sitter

To put it mildly, Tree-Sitter is a game-changer when it comes to parsing and
analyzing source code. It provides a robust and efficient way to build
incremental parsers for programming languages, enabling advanced features like
syntax highlighting, code folding, and more. Tree-Sitter is widely adopted in
various code editors and IDEs, making it an essential tool for developers who
work with code on a regular basis.

The syntax highlighting provided by Tree-Sitter is top-notch, offering
precise and context-aware highlighting that enhances code readability and
understanding. It can handle complex language constructs and edge cases that
traditional syntax highlighters often struggle with.

In a phrase, it'll knock your socks off! 😮

![Tree-Sitter](screenshots/Tree-sitter-small.png)

Tree-Sitter works with Neovim, C-Menu, and many other editors and pagers to
provide advanced syntax highlighting and code analysis features.

![Tree-Sitter in C-Menu View](screenshots/view_engine.png)

## Tree-Sitter Parsers

To install Tree-Sitter parsers for various programming languages, you can use the
following commands based on your operating system:

### Tree-Sitter Parsers On Linux

After installing Rust, you can install Tree-Sitter parsers using Cargo, Rust's
package manager. As always, I highly recommend installing only the parsers you
need. Here are some examples:

```bash
    cargo install tree-sitter-python
    cargo install tree-sitter-javascript
    cargo install tree-sitter-rust
    cargo install tree-sitter-go
    cargo install tree-sitter-cpp
```

I installed my tree-sitter parsers in the following directory structure:

```bash
~/.config/tree-sitter
  ├── config.json
  └── parsers
  ├── tree-sitter-awk
  ├── tree-sitter-bash
  ├── tree-sitter-cpp
  ├── tree-sitter-c
  ├── tree-sitter-go
  ├── tree-sitter-lua
  ├── tree-sitter-markdown
  ├── tree-sitter-rust
  └── tree-sitter-zig
```

The `config.json` file contains configuration settings for Tree-Sitter.
You will find a sample config.json file in the tree-sitter directory of thie
repository.

The `parsers` directory contains the installed Tree-Sitter parsers for
different programming languages.

To let Tree-Sitter know where to find your custom parsers, you need to
specify the parser directories in the `config.json` file. Tree-sitter will
automatically look in ~/.config/tree-sitter. Here's an example of how to
do this:

```bash
cd ~/.config/tree-sitter
vi config.json

"parser-directories": [
        /home/bill/.config/tree-sitter/parsers
]
```

You can also configure a custom color scheme in the config.json file if you like.
Here's mine:

![~/.config/tree-sitter/config.json](screenshots/tree-sitter-config.json.png)

The ~/tree-sitter/config.json distributed with tree-sitter uses the 256 color
xterm palette, but you can also use HTML style six digit hex numbers as shown
above. Refer to the Tree-Sitter documentation for more details on configuring
the color scheme.

Note: I find it much easier to use the six-digit hex color codes when configuring
Tree-Sitter colors. This way, I can easily match the colors used in my terminal
emulator and other applications. The 256 color xterm palette can be limiting
and may not provide the exact colors I want for syntax highlighting. Using
hex codes gives me more flexibility and allows for a more consistent color
scheme across my development environment. They are also more intuitive to
work with since they directly represent RGB values.

```bash
    cargo install tree-sitter-<language>
```

### Tree-Sitter Parsers On macOS

```bash
    brew install tree-sitter-<language>
```

### Tree-Sitter Parsers On Windows

```powershell
    choco install tree-sitter-<language>
```

After installation, you can verify that the Tree-Sitter parser for your chosen
language is installed correctly by running:

```bash
    tree-sitter <language> --version
```

This should display the installed Tree-Sitter parser version for your chosen
language, confirming that it is successfully installed on your system.
Replace `<language>` with the specific programming language you want to install
the parser for, such as `python`, `javascript`, `rust`, etc.

## Rustlings

Even if you are an experienced programmer, Rust is not an easy language
to learn. The ownership model and borrow checker are unique concepts that
require a different way of thinking about memory management and data lifetimes.
If you are new to programming, Rust can be even more challenging because it
requires a solid understanding of programming fundamentals.

However, with dedication and practice, anyone can learn Rust. There are many
great resources available online, including the official Rust documentation,
tutorials, and community forums. Additionally, there are many books and courses
that can help you learn Rust from scratch.

Start with the Rust Book, and concurrently do the exercises in Rustlings.
Rustlings is an invaluable companion to the Rust Book.

## Neovim

And last, but certainly not least in my list of essential tools is Neovim. I
loved vim and used it for many years. I can't say whether Vim or Neovim is
better because both have evolved to provide competitive features. I can say,
for me, Neovim plugins seem more accessible, and it has everything I want and
more.

![Neovim](screenshots/Neovim.png)

## Lazyvim

Lazyvim is a Neovim configuration that is designed to be fast, minimal, and
easy to use. It comes with a set of pre-configured plugins and settings that
enhance the Neovim experience. Lazyvim is highly customizable, allowing users
to tailor their Neovim setup to their specific needs.

![Lazyvim](screenshots/Lazyvim.png)

To install Neovim and Lazyvim, follow the instructions on the
[Lazyvim website](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

## Ghostty

Ghostty is a terminal emulator that is designed to be fast, lightweight, and
highly customizable. It is built using Rust and leverages modern technologies
to provide a smooth and efficient terminal experience. Ghostty supports
features such as GPU acceleration, ligatures, and a wide range of customization
options.

To install Ghostty, you can use the following commands based on your operating
system:

### Ghostty On Linux

![Ghostty With Neovim and Lazyvim](screenshots/Ghostty.png)

![Ghostty With Neovim and Lazyvim](screenshots/Neovim-v.png)

After installing Rust, you can install Ghostty using Cargo, Rust's package
manager:

What you see above may not be useful for development projects, but it
demonstrates Neovim, Ghostty, and Lazyvim working together in harmony to
provide great flexibility.

This feature is actually quite useful when searching for a particular source
file among many files in a large project. You can quickly preview files
without opening them fully in Neovim.

```bash
    cargo install ghostty
```

### Ghostty On macOS

```bash
    brew install ghostty
```

### Ghostty On Windows

```powershell
    choco install ghostty
```

After installation, you can verify that Ghostty is installed correctly by running:

```bash
    ghostty --version
```
